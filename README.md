# AI Agents Hackathon: TARIFFED!

### Project Goal
> The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) sets out the tariff rates and statistical categories for all merchandise imported into the United States. 
> Source: United States International Trade Commission - [Harmonized Tariff Schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/)

International trade and import laws can be bewildering, especially when considering tariffs' impact on day-to-day lives.

This problem, and the dizzying pace of news about trade wars and supply chain disruptions inspired me to apply [Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/) to pore over the corpora of tariff schedules to see how these policy changes affect us and the things we use every day. Specifically, I set out to build:

1. Several AI agents using `gpt-4o` to process questions like:
  * *Which countries are the primary importers of goods into the United States?*
  * *What is the potential average rate of duty if tariff policy changes?*
  * *What are some substitute goods that are produced domestically?*
2. A custom database representing the Harmonized Tariff Schedule and potential rates of duty for all countries.
3. A web application to set the agents to work and return the answers to those questions.

### Prerequisites
* An active Azure subscription
* A Resource Group to host Azure AI Services
* A project created in Azure [AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects?tabs=ai-studio)
  * Keep the project connection string for use in the following setup procedure
* Grounding with Bing Search resource provisioned in the resource group and [connected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview) to the Azure AI project
  * Also keep the connection name for this handy 

### Setup
* Update `ai-agents-hack-tariffed.AppHost/Properties/launchSettings.json` and modify the `BING_GROUNDING_CONNECTION_NAME` value with your value.
* Update `ai-agents-hack-tariffed.ApiService\appsettings.json` and modify the `AiAgentService` value with the AI Foundry project connection string
